## About This Version

This repository continues the work of [cap153/LANChat](https://github.com/cap153/LANChat), with a focus on the everyday Windows and Android experience:

- A redesigned Android chat composer with an in-chat half-screen gallery.
- Multi-select images, files, and installed apps on Android; app tiles show both the icon and app name.
- A unified attachment queue with continue-adding, removal, retry, and offline re-send support.
- Background system notifications on Windows and Android, with notification-to-chat navigation.
- Close-to-tray and silent launch at Windows sign-in.
- A shared light purple visual style across Windows and Android while retaining the desktop chat layout.

Local build artifacts are not committed to the source repository. Build from source using the instructions below, or obtain packaged versions from [Releases](https://github.com/acclt/LQchat/releases).

## Quick Start

### AUR

```bash
paru -S lanchat-bin
```

### Releases

[https://github.com/acclt/LQchat/releases](https://github.com/acclt/LQchat/releases)

### Build from Source

Prerequisites:

[https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

```bash
# Desktop Linux
cargo tauri build --bundles deb
cargo tauri build --bundles rpm

# Android APK
cargo tauri android build --target aarch64
./sign-apk.sh

# Windows desktop
cd src-tauri
cargo xwin build --release --bin lanchat --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Web (lightweight, no GUI dependencies)
cd src-tauri
cargo build --release --bin lanchat-web --features web --no-default-features
cargo build --no-default-features --features web --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu # Windows web
```

Or use the Makefile for one-click builds:

```bash
make all          # Build all tested platforms
make deb          # Linux .deb
make rpm          # Linux .rpm
make apk          # Android APK (auto-signed)
make windows-desktop  # Windows desktop (requires cargo-xwin)
make web          # Web (Linux)
make web-windows  # Web (Windows)
make help         # Show help
```

## Running

1. Start the service (default port `8888`, configurable in settings):

```bash
# Desktop
lanchat

# Web
lanchat-web
```

CLI arguments `--port` and `--db-path` override config file settings with highest priority.

```bash
# Web / Desktop
lanchat --port 8889 --db-path /custom/path/lanchat.db
```

> [!TIP]
> Run multiple instances by specifying different ports and database paths.  
> Use the **Add** panel with `<IP>:<port>` to discover across ports.  
> Once one side receives a heartbeat, the reply mechanism enables mutual discovery.

2. Firewall configuration (ufw example):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure both TCP and UDP are allowed for the configured port.

```bash
# TCP: Web pages and WebSocket communication
sudo ufw allow 8888/tcp
# UDP: Device discovery (broadcast/multicast/heartbeat)
sudo ufw allow 8888/udp
```

## Custom Themes

Place custom `.css` files in the config directory (any filename):

- **Linux**: `~/.config/lanchat/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\.config\lanchat`

See built-in themes for reference: [https://github.com/acclt/LANChat/tree/main/src/css](https://github.com/acclt/LANChat/tree/main/src/css)

## Config File

Port, language, and other settings are stored in `config.json`. CLI arguments `--port` and `--db-path` take highest priority.

- **Linux**: `~/.config/lanchat/config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\lanchat\config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/lanchat/config.json`

Example content:

```json
{
  "db_path": null,
  "port": 8888,
  "lang": "en"
}
```

| Field     | Description                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `db_path` | [Database path](#database); `null` = default      |
| `port`    | Listening port, default 8888                      |
| `lang`    | Interface language: `zh` (Chinese), `en` (English) |

## Database

Desktop and Web share the same database:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/com.lanchat.app/lanchat.db`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\com.lanchat.app\lanchat.db`

The database path can be changed in settings (requires restart). The path is stored in `~/.config/lanchat/config.json`.

## Troubleshooting

**Windows: missing `VCRUNTIME140.dll` / `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`:**  
[https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)  
[https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

**Windows: WebView2 not installed:**  
[https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2)

**Online user sends messages but they show as `Pending` on my side:**  
Disable mobile data / VPN and reconnect to WiFi.


**NVIDIA graphics card not rendering correctly on Linux desktop:**  
Add the environment variable `Exec=env __NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC=1 lanchat` to the desktop file.

**Cross-VLAN / WireGuard:**  
When devices are on different VLANs or connected via WireGuard, UDP broadcast won't cross subnets. Solution: use the **Add** panel to enter the peer's IP/domain/hostname with port. The system sends unicast heartbeats periodically (DNS resolution supported, 60s cache).

> [!TIP]
> Only one side needs to add the other. Upon receiving a heartbeat, the peer **auto-replies** with its own heartbeat, enabling mutual discovery without manual setup on both sides.
> Reply heartbeats include a `|1` marker to prevent infinite loops.

## Android Background Receiving

After the user explicitly opens LANChat, the Android app starts an in-process foreground service with its own persistent status notification. Pressing Home, switching apps, locking the screen, or a normal Activity recreation does not create a second network core. Swiping LANChat from Recents is treated as an explicit exit and releases the service, UDP/HTTP ports, notifications, and system locks.

The Settings panel shows the background-receive, notification-permission, and battery-optimization states. It also links to Android battery settings and provides “Stop background receiving and exit.” The app does not auto-recover after process death, device reboot, force-stop, or a Recents swipe; opening the app explicitly starts a new session.

Deep Doze and vendor-specific battery policies can still delay LAN traffic. For higher screen-off reliability, set LANChat to unrestricted battery use. Multicast discovery and direct communication with a known IP are separate paths and should be tested independently.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri 2.0
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (sqlx)
- **Network**: UDP broadcast/multicast + TCP/WebSocket + HTTP chunked upload
- **Web Server**: Axum
- **AI Bot**: [LANClaw](https://github.com/cap153/LANClaw) (separate process, driven by Pi RPC)
